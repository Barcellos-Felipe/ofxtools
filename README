pyofx is a Python library for working with Open Financial Exchange (OFX) data -
both OFXv1 (SGML) and OFXv2 (pure XML) - which is the standard format for
downloading financial information from banks and stockbrokers.

pyofx has no external dependencies beyond stdlib.

The primary facilities provided include:
    * The OFXClient class; which dowloads OFX statements from the Internet
    * The OFXParser class; which parses OFX data into a standard ElementTree
      structure for further processing in Python.
    * The OFXResponse class; which validates and converts OFX data parsed by
      OFXParser into Python types and exposes them through more Pythonic
      attribute access (e.g. OFXResponse.statements[0].ledgerbal)

INSTALLATION
Use the Python user installation scheme:
    `python setup.py install --user`

In addition to the Python package, this will also install a script 'ofxget'
in ~/.local/bin, and a sample configuration file in ~/.config/pyofx


BASIC USAGE TO DOWNLOAD OFX:
    1) Copy ~/.config/pyofx/ofxget.cfg to ~/.config/pyofx/ofxget.cfg and edit.
        Add a section for your financial institution, including URL, 
        account information, login, etc.
        See comments within.
    2) Execute getofx with appropriate arguments, e.g.
        `# python ofx.py amex stmt -s 20140101 -e 20140630 > foobar.ofx`
        See the --help for explanation of the script options
