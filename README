pyofx is a Python library for working with Open Financial Exchange (OFX) data -
both OFXv1 (SGML) and OFXv2 (pure XML) - which is the standard format for
downloading financial information from banks and stockbrokers.

pyofx has no external dependencies beyond stdlib.

The primary facilities provided include:
    * The OFXClient class; which dowloads OFX statements from the Internet
    * The OFXParser class; which parses OFX data into a standard ElementTree
      structure for further processing in Python.
    * The OFXResponse class; which validates and converts OFX data parsed by
      OFXParser into Python types and exposes them through more Pythonic
      attribute access (e.g. OFXResponse.statements[0].ledgerbal)

BASIC USAGE TO DOWNLOAD OFX:
    1) Edit pyofx.example.cfg - add a section for your financial institution,
       including URL, account information, login, etc.  See comments within.
       Save as ~/.config/pyofx/pyofx.cfg
    2) Execute ofx.py as a script, e.g.
       # python ofx.py amex stmt -s 20140101 -e 20140630 > foobar.ofx
