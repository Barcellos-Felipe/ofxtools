pyofx is a Python library for working with Open Financial Exchange (OFX) data -
both OFXv1 (SGML) and OFXv2 (pure XML) - which is the standard format for
downloading financial information from banks and stockbrokers.

pyofx has no external dependencies beyond stdlib.

The primary facilities provided include:
    * The OFXClient class, which dowloads OFX statements from the Internet
    * The OFXParser class, which converts OFX data into a standard ElementTree
      structure for further processing in Python.
      !! OFXParser is currently broken following some changes to Python 3 !!

BASIC USAGE TO DOWNLOAD OFX:
    1) Edit pyofx.example.cfg - add a section for your financial institution,
       including URL, account information, login, etc.  See comments within.
       Save as ~/.config/pyofx/pyofx.cfg
    2) Install Python 3, if you haven't.
    3) Execute ofx.py as a script, e.g.
       # python3 ofx.py amex stmt -s 20140101 -e 20140630 > foobar.ofx
