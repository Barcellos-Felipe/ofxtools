pyofx is a Python library for working with Open Financial Exchange (OFX) data - both OFXv1 (SGML) and OFXv2 (pure XML) - which is the standard format for downloading financial information from banks and stockbrokers in the USA.

The primary facilities provided include:
    * The OFXClient class, which dowloads OFX statements from the Internet
    * A wrapper to execute ofx.py as a script 
      Edit pyofx.example.cfg and save to ~/.config/pyofx/pyofx.cfg, then run
      ofx.py
    * The OFXParser class, which converts OFX data into a standard ElementTree
      structure for further processing in Python.
      !! OFXParser is currently broken following some changes to Python 3 !!

pyofx has no external dependencies beyond stdlib.
